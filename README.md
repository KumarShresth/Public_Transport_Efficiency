# Public_Transport_Efficiency
This project uses Dijkstra's Algorithm to find out the efficiency of public transportation system.

## Running the code
The main file is <ins>**cityefficiency.cpp**</ins>. <br/>
The code can run by simply compiling and running, as the adjacency matrix has been included, but it is recommended to take output in a separate text file.
To get output in a separate file, run the following code in VS Code terminal
```
g++ cityefficiency.cpp -o program
./program >> ratingafterpaths.txt
```

## File descriptions
The following are the files in the repository and their descriptions. <br/><br/>
cityefficiency.cpp - main program file. <br/>
adjacencymat.txt - adjacency matrix before metro/bus path are established.<br/>
adjacencymatafterpath.txt - adjacency matrix after metro/bus path are established.<br/>
allpaths.txt - all metro/bus path descriptions.<br/>
ratingbeforepaths.txt - caculated rating matrix before paths are established.<br/>
ratingafterpaths.txt - caculated rating matrix after paths are established.<br/>
<br/>
Finally a report on the project is also attached.
